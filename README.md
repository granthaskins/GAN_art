Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts that leverage state-of-the-art computer vision and generative AI techniques to produce unique pieces of art. Whether you are interested in GANs, Diffusion Models, or DeepDream, this repository has something to offer. Each technique is implemented in a script, demonstrating its capabilities and providing a starting point for further exploration and experimentation.

Techniques Used
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other in a zero-sum game. The generator creates images, while the discriminator evaluates them. This adversarial process results in the generator producing increasingly realistic images.

Diffusion Models
Diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising a sample of random noise. These models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality, diverse images and are a powerful tool for creating art.

DeepDream
DeepDream is a computer vision technique that enhances patterns in images by leveraging neural networks trained on image recognition tasks. By iteratively adjusting the input image to maximize the activation of certain neurons, DeepDream produces hallucinogenic and surreal visuals.

Setup and Installation
